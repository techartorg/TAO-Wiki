Welcome to the TAO-Wiki...wiki!

### How to contribute:

If your code program/language does not already exist in the side bar ->
Please do the following, if it does exist already skip to the next section:
1. Make a new page for your program/language such as "Maya"
2. Save the page and then click the pencil (edit) icon on the Sidebar (at the top) 
3. Add `[Language/Program](https://github.com/techartorg/TAO-Wiki/wiki/{Language/Program})` into the page (preferably "alphabetical" At least try is all we ask)

Then you're ready to follow the next section for creating your snippet page.
1. Create a new page and call it `[Language/Program] {Descriptive name of snippet}`
2. Add your snippet and save.
3. Navigate to the main `Language/Program` page for your snippet
4. Edit the page and add a new link in the page to your new snippet page.

This will keep the sidebar clean and clear.
