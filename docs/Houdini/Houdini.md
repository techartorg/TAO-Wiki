# Welcome to the TAO Houdini Page!

These are current drops of wisdom transcribed from the fast moving current of the Slack flow. 

Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€” like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
-Bruce Lee
