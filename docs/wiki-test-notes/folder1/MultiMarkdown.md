In order to create valid [HTML], you need properly
coded syntax that can be cumbersome for 
"non-programmers" to write. Sometimes, you just want
to easily make certain words **bold**, and certain 
words *italicized* without having to remember the 
syntax. Additionally, for example, creating lists:

* should be easy
* should not involve programming
